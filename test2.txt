		<h1><pre>Key facts
In 2020, 54% of the global population (4.2 billion people) used a safely managed sanitation service.
Over 1.7 billion people still do not have basic sanitation services, such as private toilets or latrines.
494 million still defecate in the open,eg- in street gutters, behind bushes or into open bodies of water.
In 2020, 45% of the household wastewater generated globally was discharged without safe treatment.
At least 10% of the world’s population is thought to consume food irrigated by wastewater.
Poor sanitation reduces human well-being, social and economic development due to impacts such as anxiety,
risk of sexual assault, and lost opportunities for education and work.
Poor sanitation is linked to transmission of diarrhoeal diseases such as cholera and dysentery, as well
as typhoid, intestinal worm infections and polio.
It exacerbates stunting and contributes to the spread of antimicrobial resistance.</pre></h1>
			<h1>Overview<h1>
			<h2><pre>
Some 829 000 people in low- and middle-income countries die as a result of inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene each year, representing 
60% of total diarrhoeal deaths. Poor sanitation is believed to be the main cause in some 432 000 of these deaths and is a major factor
in several neglected tropical diseases, including intestinal worms, schistosomiasis, and trachoma. Poor sanitation also contributes to 
malnutrition.
In 2020, 54% of the global population (4.2 billion people) used a safely managed sanitation service; 34% (2.6 billion people) 
used private sanitation facilities connected to sewers from which wastewater was treated; 20% (1.6 billion people) used toilets or latrines
where excreta were safely disposed of in situ; and 78% of the world’s population (6.1 billion people) used at least a basic sanitation
service. Diarrhoea remains a major killer but is largely preventable. Better water, sanitation, and hygiene could prevent the deaths of
297 000 children aged under 5 years each year. 
Open defecation perpetuates a vicious cycle of disease and poverty.The countries where open defection is most 
widespread have the highest number of deaths of children aged under 5 years as well as the highest levels of malnutrition and
poverty, and big disparities of wealth.
